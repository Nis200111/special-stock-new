# ✅ FIXED: Dashboard Runtime Error

## 🔍 The Issue
The error `uploadSuccess is not defined` occurred because I accidentally removed some variables used for the "Upload Image" section when I added the new Statistics features.

## 🛠️ The Fix
I have restored the missing variables (`uploadSuccess`, `uploadError`, and `uploadedImages`) in `AdminDashboard.jsx`.

## 🔄 Status
The Dashboard should now load correctly without any errors. Please refresh the page.
